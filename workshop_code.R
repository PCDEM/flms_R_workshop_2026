#'******R for Beginners Workshop******

#'This script is a part of the R Beginners Workshop. You can either follow along
#'with this script, or make a new script and type along as the workshop progresses.


# Running code------------------------------------------------------------------

# You can run a line of code by placing the cursor before the line or anywhere
# in the line and pressing 'Ctrl + Enter' (Windows) or 'Cmd + Enter' (Mac).
500

# You can also highlight a block of code and run it all at once. 
100

300


# Basic math--------------------------------------------------------------------

5 + 5  # Addition
5 - 5  # Subtraction
5 * 5  # Multiplication
5 / 5  # Division
5 ^ 5  # Exponentiation (or **)
log(100) # Natural log
6*4/(2^2*3)-2 # PEMDAS

# R follows the basic order of operations (PEMDAS), so be sure to use parentheses
# where necessary.

# Notice the matching parentheses are highlighted when your cursor moves over one:
#(((())))

# Logicals and Booleans-------------------------------------------------------

# R has several built-in logical operators that can be used to compare values.
# Some of the logical operators and booleans are:
# x < y  # Less than
# x > y # Greater than
# == # Equal to
# x <= y # Less than or equal to
# x >= y # Greater than or equal to
# x != y # Not equal to
# x | y # Or
# x & y # And
# x %in% y # Is in
# is.na(x) # Is missing
# !is.na(x) # Is not missing

1 > 2  # returns FALSE
1 < 2  # returns TRUE
1 == 2 # returns FALSE
1 != 2 # returns TRUE
1 < 2 | 3 > 4 # returns TRUE; OR: only one test needs to be true to return TRUE
1 < 2 & 3 > 4 # returns FALSE; AND: both tests need to be true to return TRUE


# Watch for how you set the precedence of the logical operators and booleans

1 > 0.5 & 2 # This returns TRUE because R coerces 2 to be a logical (TRUE)

as.logical(2) # returns TRUE; all non-zero numbers are TRUE and 0 is FALSE

1 > 0.5 & 1 > 2 # returns FALSE; need to be explicit about both tests


# Assigning variables-----------------------------------------------------------

# Use the assignment operator '<-' to assign a value to an object
x <- "Hello, World!"
# Call the object 'x' to see the value
x 

# When you call 'x' notice that "Hello, World!" is printed to the console.
# You can also use the '=' sign to assign a value to an object but it is not
# recommended. Using the '<-' operator is considered a best practice for R coding.

# If you check in the Environment tab in RStudio, you will see that 'x' is now an 
# object with the value "Hello, World!".


# Naming variables--------------------------------------------------------------

# Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start
# with a number. Variable names are case-sensitive, so 'x' and 'X' are different.
# There are some naming conventions to keep in mind when naming variables:

# 1) Use descriptive names for objects and functions
# 2) Use camelCase or snake_case for naming objects and functions
# 3) Keep names short but descriptive
# 4) Avoid using special characters (e.g. $, %, &, etc.) in variable names
# 5) Don't start variable names with a number

# Good examples:
avgTemp <- 75
avg_temp <- 75

# Bad examples:
avarageTemperature1_2 <- 75 # misspelled "average" and too long
avge.T <- 75 # Not descriptive enough
1stAvgTemp <- 75 # variable name cannot start with a number
avgTemp% <- 75 # variable name cannot contain special characters

# These naming conventions aren't required but you should be consistent when naming
# functions and objects within a project to help keep your code organized.

# Some variable names are reserved for R functions and cannot be used as variable names.

# Control structures
  # if
  # else
  # while
# Function definition
  # function
# Constants
  # for
  # TRUE
  # FALSE
  # NULL
  # Inf
  # NaN
  # NA

# Functions---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. You can create your
# own functions or use built-in functions. Functions can take arguments (inputs)
# and return values (outputs). 

# Return the mean value of the numbers 1, 2, and 3
mean(x = c(1, 2, 3))

# Return the minimum value of the numbers 1, 2, and 3
min(x = c(1, 2, 3))

# Return the standard deviation of the numbers 1, 2, and 3
sd(c(1, 2, 3)) # note that the argument is not named in this case

# If you want to read documentation about a function, you can use the '?' operator
# with the function name. The function documentation will appear in the 'Help' tab
# in RStudio.
?mean


# Objects-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Objects are the basic building blocks of R. Everything in R is an object, including
# functions, data frames, and vectors. You can create objects using the assignment
# operator '<-'.

# Create a numeric vector object
e <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Hand calculate the mean
sum(e) / length(e)

# R functions to calculate the mean
mean(e) 

# Make a dataframe object
e <- data.frame(x = 1:5,
                y = 11:15)
e

# Get the mean of the y column
mean(y)

# Notice that the previous line returns an error: "object 'y' not found". This is
# because it is not in the global environment. You need to use the '$' operator 
# to access the y column in the dataframe.
mean(e$y)

# R will look for named objects in the environment, since 'y' wasn't in the 
# environment, it gave up and returned an error.

 
# Vectors-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Vectors are one-dimensional arrays that can hold numeric, character, or logical
# data. You can create a vector using the 'c()' function.

# Numeric vector
myVec <- 1:10

# Check to see if my_vec is a vector
is.vector(myVec)

# Character vector
chrVec <- c('1','2','3','4','5')

# Check to see if chr_vec is a vector
is.vector(chrVec)

# Both vectors contain the same values but the first vector is numeric and the
# second vector is character. You can check the class of an object using the
# 'class()' function.
class(myVec)
class(chrVec)

# Notice the difference in the class of the two vectors. myVec is of class
# 'numeric' and chrVec is of class 'character'.

# A vector can also be a list of objects of varying classes and lengths. 

# Make a list of different objects
myList <- list(a = 1:4, b = "Hello, World!", c = data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 11:15))
myList

# Check if myList is a vector and a list
is.vector(myList) # returns TRUE
is.list(myList) # returns TRUE


# Indexing Vectors--------------------------------------------------------------

# You can access elements of a vector using the square brackets '[]' and the index
# of the element you want to access. R uses 1-based indexing, so the first element
# of a vector is at index 1.

# Create vector of random numbers
vec <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 30, sd = 10)
vec

# Get the first element of the vector
vec[1]

# Get the first 5 elements of the vector
vec[1:5]

# Get the first, third, and fifth elements of the vector
vec[c(1, 3, 5)]

# Return all values EXCEPT the first thrid and fifth elements
vec[-c(1, 3, 5)]

# Return all values greate than 30
vec[vec > 30]


# Indexing Lists----------------------------------------------------------------

# You can access elements of a list using the double square brackets '[[]]' and
# the index of the element you want to access. You can also use the '$' operator
# to access elements of a list by name.

# Create a list of different objects
myList <- list(num = 1:5, name = c('Joe', 'Bob', 'Mary'))

# Return the first vector in the list
myList[[1]]

# Return the first element of the second vector in the list
myList[[2]][1]

# Return the first vector in the list using the '$' operator
myList$num

# Return the first element of the second vector in the list using the '$' operator
myList$name[1]


# Installing and Loading Packages-----------------------------------------------

# R has a large number of packages that can be used to extend its functionality.
# You can install packages from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) using the
# 'install.packages()' function. You only need to install a package once, but you
# need to load it every time you start a new R session using the 'library()' function.

# Install a package
install.packages('ggplot2')

# Load a package
library(ggplot2)


# Setting Working Directory-----------------------------------------------------

# Get the working directory (folder where R looks for and saves files to)
getwd()

# Set the working directory to the folder where your files are
setwd("C:/path/to/your/folder")



# Your Turn---------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1) Install and load the packages tidyverse, psych, and palmerpenguins using the 
#    install.packages() and library() functions.

# 2) Make a vector of 50 random values with a mean and standard deviation of your 
#    choice using the `rnorm()` function and assign it to a variable named `vec` 
#    (hint: use `?rnorm` to read the argument descriptions).

# 3) Get summary statistics for the vector using the describe() function.

# 4) Use [] indexing to return the first 10 values of the vector.

# 5) Plot your data using the plot() function. 



# Penguins Data-----------------------------------------------------------------

# The Palmer Penguins dataset is a dataset that contains information about penguins
# in the Palmer Archipelago.

# Load the penguins dataset from the palmerpenguins package if you haven't already
library(palmerpenguins)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(penguins)

# Get the structure of the dataset
str(penguins)

# Inspect the data closer in a new tab
View(penguins)

# Get the data at the first row and first column position
penguins[1, 1]

# Get the data in the first row and columns 1 and 2
penguins[1, 1:2]

# Get the data in the first rows and columns 1 and 4
penguins[1, c(1, 4)]

# Return the data except for the first column
penguins[, -1]

# Look at the column names of the dataset, compare it to the negative indexing
# to see that the first column (species) is not included
names(penguins)

# You can also use the '$' operator to access columns in a dataframe based on the
# name of that columns.

# Return the species column
penguins$species

# You can also combine the '$' operator with the '[]' operator to access specific 
# rows.

# Return the first 10 rows of the species column
penguins$species[1:10]

# Indexing based on tests is a way that you can filter the data to meet certain
# criteria that you can specify.

# Return the species and island columns for the penguins data but only for female
# penguins
penguins[penguins["sex"] == 'female', c("species", "island")]


# Tidyverse---------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a common philosophy and
# are designed to work together. The Tidyverse includes packages like dplyr, ggplot2,
# tidyr, and readr. Piping is a key feature of the Tidyverse and allows you to
# chain functions together using the '%>%' operator. 

install.packages('tidyverse')
library(tidyverse)

# Notice the conflicts when you load the tidyverse. 

# ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts()
# ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
# ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

# This is because the Tidyverse packages have functions with the same name as base
# R functions. If you wanted to use a base R function, you would need to specify
# the package name before the function name using '::' (e.g. stats::filter()).


# Now that you have loaded the Tidyverse, you can use the piping operator (%>%
# or |>) to chain functions together instead of nesting them.

# Instead of this nested function call:
round(log(mean(penguins$body_mass_g[penguins$species == 'Adelie' & penguins$island == 'Torgersen'], 
               na.rm = TRUE)), 0)

# You can do this:
penguins |> # start with the dataset
  filter(species == 'Adelie', island == 'Torgersen') |> # filter the data 
  summarise(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)) |> # calculate the mean
  pull(mean_mass) |> # pull out the mean mass
  log() |> # notice no arguments inside parentheses
  round(0) # round the result

#------------------
# EXAMPLE

# Calculate the average bill length
mean(penguins$bill_length_mm)

# Notice the above line returns NA because there are missing values in the dataset
# and R doesn't know how to handle them. You can use the na.rm argument to remove
# the missing values from the calculation.
mean(penguins$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)

# The tidyverse version would be:
penguins |>
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) 

#-------------------
# EXAMPLE

# Calculate the average body mass of male chinstrap penguins after 2007.
penguins |>
  filter(sex == 'male', species == 'Chinstrap', year > 2007) |>
  summarise(mean_mass= mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))


# Your Turn---------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1) Find the minimum value of flipper_length_mm

# 2) Find the maximum value of body_mass_g

# 3) Filter the data by selecting any two columns using the column position or $ operator

# 4) Assign steps 1-3 to individual variables


# BONUS) Create a new data object of with 2 columns: body mass and flipper length 
# for all penguins, then plot them against each other using the plot() function. 
# (hint: for tidyverse, check the documentation for select())



# R Coding Best Practices-------------------------------------------------------

# 1) Break code into sections (not necessary but helpful to keep code organized)

# 2) Put all library() calls at the beginning of each section

# 3) Use comments to explain WHY the code is doing something rather than
#    WHAT it's doing (unless it is a complex chunk of code)

# 4) Keep naming conventions consistent throughout the script. The best naming
#    conventions are:
#       - Use descriptive names for objects and functions
#       - Use camelCase or snake_case for naming objects and functions
# 
#       avgTemp <- 75 #Good
#       avg_temp <- 75 #Good
#       At1_2  <- 75 #Bad

# 5) Use the '<-' operator for assignment rather than '='

# 6) Keep lines of code to a maximum of 80 characters (use the line in RStudio)

# These are just a few best practices to keep in mind when writing R code. They
# are guidelines that are optional to implement but will help to keep your code
# organized, clean-looking, and readable which will help you in the long run if
# you return to the code at a later date.
